# Diagnose-Covid-19-from-Respiratory-Sound

This repository contains implementation of Automatic Diagnosis of Covid-19 from respiratory sound data which is inspried by the research of [University of Cambridge](https://covid-19-sounds.org/en/) on this.[Click here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05919) to have a look on the research paper.

# Background
Research has now started to use digital technology to gather respiratory sound, which could then be used for automatic analysis using Artificial Intelligence. Such a research by University of Cambridge, shows promise in detecting diagnostic signals of Covid-19 from voice and coughs. Inspired by this work, I tried to diagnose of Covid-19 from coughs which definitely shows promise.

# Data Collection
For this project I used the data of [Project Cowsara](https://coswara.iisc.ac.in/) of IISc Bangalore which is a attempt to build a diagnostic tool based on respiratory cough and speech sound. For now, I only used the cough data. [Click here](notebooks/visualization/metadata_visualization) to look at the metadata with visualization.
